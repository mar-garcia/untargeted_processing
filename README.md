# Untargeted metabolomics processing pipeline

This repo contains the codes for general data processing of LC-MS 
untargeted metabolomics experiments using XCMS.  
  
Below there are described the codes and their main use:  
  
  * **XCMS_processing.Rmd:** processing FS data in a specific polarity.  
  * **MS2_library.Rmd:** import all MS2 experiments to an R workspace file.  
  * **feature_grouping.Rmd:** group features according different characteristics.

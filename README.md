# Untargeted metabolomics processing pipeline

This repository contains the codes for general data processing of LC-MS untargeted metabolomics experiments using XCMS.  
  
Data collected in an experiment in which different white and red wines from different varieties were injected in the HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap instrument.  
The dataset comprises 88 mzML files, with 10 samples each from white and red wines, 14 quality control (QC) samples, representing a pool of all wines, 7 blanks and additional 7 injections of blanks and QCs to equilibrate the system before starting the sequence.


## Files and structure of the analysis  
  
  - [1_Sequence.R](1_Sequence.R): Defines who the injection sequence has been generated  
  - [2_Artefact_filter_FT.Rmd](2_Artefact_filter_FT.Rmd): Removes the fast fourier artifact peaks from spectra, typically contained in data generated by Orbitrap instruments.  
  - [3_Parameters_setup.Rmd](3_Parameters_setup.Rmd): Different checks to determine the values to indicate in different parameters used in the XCMS functions.  
  - [4_XCMS_processing.Rmd](4_XCMS_processing.Rmd): Data processing including chromatographic peak detection, retention time alignment, correspondance (peak grouping) and gap filling (initial general inspection).  
  - 5 - Annotation: 6a CompoundDB, 6b Feature annotation  
  - 6 - Postprocessing of annotated features  
  - 7 - Statistical analysis: overview with PCA, tests to select bk of color/variety
